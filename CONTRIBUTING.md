## Contributing
TypeScript is currently accepting contributions in the form of bug fixes. A bug must have an issue tracking it in the issue tracker that has been approved ("Milestone == Community") by the TypeScript team. Your pull request should include a link to the bug that you are fixing. If you’ve submitted a PR for a bug, please post a comment in the bug to avoid duplication of effort.

New samples will not be accepted at this time.

You will need to complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Briefly, this agreement testifies that you are granting us permission to use the submitted change according to the terms of the project’s license, and that the work being submitted is under appropriate copyright.

Download the agreement ([Microsoft Contribution License Agreement.docx](https://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=typescript&DownloadId=822190)), sign, scan, and email it back to <cla@microsoft.com>.
